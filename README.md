### OMR, what?

This is the new Old Mahabalipuram Road: from a deserted stretch of road dotted with software companies, the IT corridor is fast on its way to becoming a food lover’s paradise. A quick search on sites like Zomato or Burrp confirms this. The nearly **25 km stretch from Madhya Kailash junction to Siruseri** is chock-a-bloc with choices: *Fast food, Biryani, Arabian, Chinese, North Indian, South Indian, Bengali, Thai, Japanese, Andhra, Continental, Italian, Malaysian, Mexican, Street food...* Whatever you’re in the mood for, it looks like OMR is the place to go.
